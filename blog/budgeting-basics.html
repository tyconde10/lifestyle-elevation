                <h1>Budgeting Basics: How to Build a Plan You Can Stick To</h1>
                <p>Creating a budget doesn't have to be complicated or restrictive. A smart budget helps you understand where your money is going, prioritize spending on what matters most, and identify areas where you can save. Here's a clear, no-nonsense approach to building a budget you’ll actually use.</p>
                <h2>1. Know Your Numbers</h2>
                <p>Start by gathering your monthly income and fixed expenses. This includes your salary, freelance income, rent or mortgage, utilities, insurance, and any other recurring bills. Understanding these numbers is critical to setting a realistic plan.</p>
                <h2>2. Categorize Your Spending</h2>
                <p>Break down your spending into categories such as housing, transportation, food, entertainment, and savings. Be honest with yourself — tracking your spending for a month can help you see where money is leaking. Use a simple spreadsheet or a budgeting app if you prefer digital tools.</p>
                <h2>3. Pay Yourself First</h2>
                <p>One of the smartest moves you can make is to treat savings as a non-negotiable expense. Before spending on anything else, move a portion of your income into a savings or investment account. Automating this process will keep you consistent.</p>
                <h2>4. Adjust and Review</h2>
                <p>Your budget should be a living document. Review it monthly, adjust categories as your life changes, and don’t beat yourself up over occasional deviations. The goal is progress, not perfection.</p>
